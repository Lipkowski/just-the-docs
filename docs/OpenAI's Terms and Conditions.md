When engaging with any online platform or service, it's crucial to understand the terms and conditions that govern your interaction. OpenAI has its own set of terms and conditions that users should be familiar with.

## Data Collection and Usage

OpenAI collects user data (Point 1, Personal information we collect) following applicable privacy laws and regulations. The company is committed to using data responsibly and solely for the purposes outlined in its privacy policy. OpenAI emphasizes the importance of safeguarding user information and maintaining the confidentiality of any data shared with its systems. 

Users have the right to manage their data and can exercise their preferences regarding the collection, storage, and processing of their information.

In the words of OpenAI:

>When you use our non-API consumer services ChatGPT or DALL-E, we may use the data you provide us to improve our models. You can switch off training in ChatGPT settings (under Data Controls) to turn off training for any conversations created while training is disabled or you can submit [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrnC-_A7JFs4LbIuzevQ_78hVERlNqqCPCt3d8XqnKOfdRdQ/viewform). Once you opt out, new conversations will not be used to train our models.<br>
